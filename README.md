# aloha-project-B
Second project for Red Academy Web Developer Professional program

This project was created with HTML, CSS, JQuery, and JavaScript.

It consists of a home page for a fashion brand with several sections, including:

| sticky navigation bar
| banner
| call to action
| a gallery of product categories
| featured products displayed in a jQuery carousel with an "add to cart" button that increments the counter in the cart icon at the top of the page.
| a form to subscribe to the company's newsletter
| a footer which displays contact information and social media icons


The project is not quite perfect yet. There are some unresolved problems with the placement of the text and images in the banner at different screen sizes.
I need to do a colossal refactoring of the CSS stylesheet to change it over to mobile-first and to tidy it up and reduce the amount of code. 
Part and parcel of the aforementioned refactoring is improving the media queries to debug the responsive views of the site. The product carousel works outside of Github, but does not currently appear in the Github.io preview for some reason.
